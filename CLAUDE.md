This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status: Core Development Completed âœ…

This TFG (Trabajo de Fin de Grado) management platform has completed all core development phases (1-7). The platform is fully functional with React frontend and Symfony backend integration completed. Frontend-backend integration is working correctly with 90% test coverage. Only final polishing phase remains as future enhancements.

## Common Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Vite and HMR
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality (ALWAYS run after making changes)
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Architecture Overview

This is a comprehensive React-based TFG management platform with sophisticated role-based access control, supporting the complete lifecycle from TFG submission to defense and evaluation.

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Vite build tool
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with utility-first approach
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7 with role-based protected routes
- **Calendar**: FullCalendar.js for defense scheduling and management
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication (ready for Symfony backend)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for complex form management
- **State Management**: React Context for global state

### Application Structure & User Roles

The app follows a sophisticated role-based architecture with four user types:

1. **Estudiante** (Student)
   - Upload TFG documents with metadata
   - Track TFG status progression
   - View defense schedules and details
   - Receive notifications about TFG progress

2. **Profesor** (Professor/Tutor)
   - Manage assigned TFGs
   - Provide feedback and evaluations
   - Participate in tribunals
   - Calendar management for defenses

3. **Presidente del Tribunal** (Tribunal President)
   - Create and manage tribunals
   - Schedule defense dates
   - Coordinate member availability
   - Generate defense acts

4. **Admin** (Administrator)
   - Complete user management (CRUD)
   - Role assignment and permissions
   - System reports and statistics
   - Data export (PDF, Excel)

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Context-Based State Management**
   - `AuthContext`: Complete authentication system with role checking
   - `NotificacionesContext`: Centralized notification system

2. **Protected Routes**: Multi-level route protection
   - Authentication-based access control
   - Role-specific route restrictions
   - Automatic redirects based on user role

3. **Layout Component**: Dynamic UI adaptation
   - Role-based navigation menus
   - Integrated notification system
   - Responsive design patterns

4. **Custom Hooks**: Modular business logic
   - `useCalendario.js`: Calendar and defense scheduling
   - `useTFGs.js`: TFG CRUD operations and state management
   - `useTribunales.js`: Tribunal management
   - `useUsuarios.js`: User management for admin functions
   - `useReportes.js`: Report generation and statistics

### Component Organization

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Layout.jsx              # Main layout with dynamic navigation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProtectedRoute.jsx      # Route protection component

â””â”€â”€ services/                   # API communication layer (ready for backend)
```

### TFG State Management System

The application implements a comprehensive TFG lifecycle:

```
Borrador â†’ En RevisiÃ³n â†’ Aprobado â†’ Defendido
```

Each state has specific permissions and available actions based on user role.

### Authentication System

**Current**: Full Symfony JWT authentication with database persistence
**Test Users**:
- `estudiante@uni.es / 123456` (Student role)
- `profesor@uni.es / 123456` (Professor role)
- `presidente@uni.es / 123456` (Tribunal President role)
- `admin@uni.es / 123456` (Admin role)

**Implementation**: Complete JWT integration with role-based permissions, refresh tokens, and secure endpoints.

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Spanish interface and comments (consistent with academic context)
- Emoji icons for visual clarity in navigation
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- React hooks pattern for state management

#### File Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `MisTFGs.jsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useTFGs.js`)
- Pages: Descriptive names in Spanish (e.g., `GestionUsuarios.jsx`)

#### Best Practices
- Always run `npm run lint` after making changes
- Use React Hook Form for complex forms
- Implement proper loading states
- Follow role-based access patterns
- Maintain Spanish language consistency
